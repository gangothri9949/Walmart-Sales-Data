## üîé **Analysis Approach**
1. Data Wrangling

Created a MySQL database and imported the dataset.

Checked for NULL values (none found, as all fields were NOT NULL).

Verified data types for accuracy.


### 2. **Feature Engineering**


To make the analysis more insightful, additional columns were derived:

time_of_day ‚Üí Categorized into Morning, Afternoon, Evening.

day_name ‚Üí Extracted weekday name from the date.

month_name ‚Üí Extracted month name from the date.

These features helped analyze sales by time, weekday, and month.
